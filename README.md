# MODELING-OF-TRANSMISSION-LINE-
MODELING OF TRANSMISSION LINE  USING MATLAB
I developed a comprehensive model of a transmission line using MATLAB. This project involved creating a detailed simulation of transmission line behavior under various conditions. By utilizing MATLAB, I was able to model the electrical properties of the transmission line, such as resistance, inductance, capacitance, and conductance. The simulation included analysis of voltage, current, and power flow along the transmission line, as well as the effects of line losses and impedance matching. This project provided valuable insights into the performance and reliability of transmission lines in power systems.
